# Physics Simulations

A collection of physics simulations built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and [Planck](https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js/). 

## Develop

Npm is used to manage the dependencies. Run `npm ci`

## Run

Running requires a web server, you cannot just open index.html locally in your browser. The simplest thing to do is just open the project in Intellij and right click on index.html and select "Open in Browser". Intellij has its own internal webserver. Alternatively, you can put all these files in htdocs dir wherever you have a webserver.
